### Introduction

Before contributing or comment, please note that I am NOT a professional infosec or pen tester. I am just a student who want to learn and taught to others. Other contributors might be students as well, so be patient and indulgent with everyone. Do not forget that the main goal here is to write about ethical hacking and learn to others. Tools that are just about malicious hacking and not useful for a pen tester will not be added to the list.

### Before submitting a new tool

Please don't submit unverified or untested tools. We only want to share the best tools with good community of contributors. If you've created a tool, be sure the code is stable and will be maintened. We will test the tool if we don't see enought contributors on it.
